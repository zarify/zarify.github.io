      <title>Agent Experiment</title>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to avoid all the AI infesting everything these days, but apart from using
completions a bit in VSCode Copilot with the occasional conversation about different
libraries (which I find a pretty pleasant way to learn about new things, even if
those new things are occasionally BS) I haven&amp;rsquo;t really used it for code a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read Github&amp;rsquo;s breathless &amp;ldquo;now, with AGENTS&amp;rdquo; release a while back, and never really
gave it much thought until they also put out their
&lt;a href=&#34;https://microsoft.github.io/CopilotAdventures/&#34;&gt;Copilot Adventures&lt;/a&gt; &amp;hellip; tutorials?
The word &amp;ldquo;tutorial&amp;rdquo; feels a bit off, since the activities are couched in terms of
&amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re going to make X!&amp;rdquo; but you&amp;rsquo;re not really making anything - you&amp;rsquo;re just being
given examples of prompt structure to get the agent to build the thing for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LLMs at the Arcade</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was mentoring at our local fortnightly Coder Dojo session yesterday and heard a couple of students talking about getting help from ChatGPT. My ears pricked up because these are mostly younger kids (mid-late primary, a few in early secondary) and, as much as I try to encourage them to broaden their horizons, usually are firmly in Scratch-land, with a few who have been working in &lt;a href=&#34;https://arcade.makecode.com&#34;&gt;MakeCode Arcade&lt;/a&gt;; how were they using LLMs here?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
