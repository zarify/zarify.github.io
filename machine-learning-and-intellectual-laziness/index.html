For example, it will learn whether you‚Äôre more of a ‚Äúhaha‚Äù vs. ‚Äúlol‚Äù kind of person. The more you use Allo the more ‚Äúyou‚Äù the suggestions will become.

Google Inbox has done this for a while. iOS has had suggested words above the keyboard for a while now as well (although I doubt anyone uses it in the predictive sense as opposed to suggestions once you start typing, except for entertainment purposes).\nOne of the things I worry about is the problem we already have with the idea of filter bubbles:¬†The content which algorithms predict we will want is preferentially shown to us based on what we have viewed, liked, tweeted about and so on.\nWhile the idea of filter bubbles is a bit more extreme than suggested replies, the concept is pretty much the same: an algorithm suggests ideas to us which, although some would be based on how we have reacted to similar content before, Google‚Äôs strength has always been analysis of aggregate data, so some aspects are always going to be taken from how other users have reacted and trained the system. As a result there will probably some homogeneity to the suggested context for the reply.\nAssuming that Smart Reply gets good enough to actually use day to day, at what point do we as users start thinking of these replies as ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù and stop thinking about the nuance of the language we use? A parallel situation that I think already shows this sort of effect is the use of emoji in text messages, tweets and so on. We often use a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù glyph in place of articulating our thoughts more thoroughly.¬†(Full disclosure: I adore the shocked face emoji and use it at every opportunity üò±)\nSo what I wonder is, if we allow machine learning algorithms to suggest responses for us, do we reach the point where we actually stop thinking about the content we view as thoroughly as we might otherwise do (or perhaps as much as we should do)?\n‚ÄúMy Wife and my Mother-In-Law‚Äù¬†William Ely Hil\nAs a relatively unimportant example, let‚Äôs look at images which demonstrate perceptual ambiguity, such as the one which I‚Äôm sure everyone has seen, the old woman/young woman.

<p>Google Allo (which of course makes me think of the classically cheesy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/'Allo_'Allo!">&lsquo;Allo &lsquo;Allo</a>) was outlined in the recent <a href="https://events.google.com/io2016/">Google IO</a> keynote. One of the features which bears some consideration is Smart Reply which suggests replies to messaging and learns from your responses over time (and I assume also does learning on the aggregate, playing to Google&rsquo;s strengths in large scale data analysis.</p>
<p>Over at the <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2016/05/allo-duo-apps-messaging-video.html">Google blog</a> they have this to say about Smart Reply</p>
