  <div class="post-content"><p>This morning I hit the release button on my holiday project, Repeat.</p>
<p>As part of my marathon of listening to every development podcast I can, I was recently catching up on the backlog of Release Notes episodes, and in particular the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/44-justin-williams-part-1/">two</a> <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/45-justin-williams-part-2/">episodes</a> with guest Justin Williams, where he joked that like every other developer, he started out with a notes app, a task manager and a bug tracker.</p>
<p>Repeat is my task manager (at this point I don&rsquo;t plan on making a notes app or a bug tracker though&hellip;).</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, my wife mentioned to me that someone should make an app for medication reminders, and I thought I&rsquo;d use some of my holidays making one. Now of course, there <em>are</em> apps for medication reminders out there, but I didn&rsquo;t look at what was available until I had fleshed out all of my basic features which I thought were necessary for release. Mostly because I&rsquo;m an idiot who likes wasting his time, but partly because I&rsquo;ve been itching to see something through for iOS for over a year and the feature set seemed pretty achievable for a first attempt. Repeat isn&rsquo;t just a medication reminder, and it&rsquo;s both more and less than Apple&rsquo;s Reminders app. Over all I&rsquo;m pretty happy at where it landed, feature-wise: somewhere in between a pill caddy and general purpose reminders.</p>
<p>I first submitted Repeat for review over a fortnight ago, and after getting knocked back by the review team for a usability issue which I decided to change rather than argue about, and pulling it from review myself after noticing a layout bug which made the app unusable in iPad scaling modes and on 3.5&quot; devices (if anyone still has those and are on iOS 9+, which I made a requirement), it was approved. The wait has been interesting, since in the meantime I&rsquo;ve been working on features for the next version, without knowing whether it would be approved or if anyone will actually buy it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a mixed bag of emotions since getting to the point where I thought I might actually get Repeat&rsquo;s 1.0 finished. There&rsquo;s been a large dose of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>, since I&rsquo;m not a designer and my development skills for anything past small projects are very rusty. At times it has been a bit of a battle to keep at it and finish features, especially after starting to research the functionality of other reminder apps out there. This has been offset by the joy I continue to feel at successfully solving code or logic problems that have had me muttering at my laptop in frustration.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://headtilt.me/first-time-development/">first post</a> on developing the app, I wrote about some of the uncertainty I faced when it comes to the business aspect like pricing and marketing; all of that uncertainty is still there. My app is <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/10">designed by a programmer</a> (although nowhere near <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/this-is-what-happens-when-you-let-developers-create-ui/">as bad as this!</a>). I don&rsquo;t have a business or marketing background. This is all just something that will have to come with experience as I either learn for myself or from what other developers share.</p>
<p>The one bit of uncertainty I&rsquo;ve cleared up (until experience proves otherwise) is pricing. Originally I wavered between free, free with ads and free with IAP. Thinking about it more though, I&rsquo;ve decided to charge up front for Repeat, at something other than the bottom $0.99 tier. First, it gives me something to commit to: if people are paying me money for it, there is an implicit understanding that they&rsquo;ll get somthing for it, like bug fixes and feature updates, even if they won&rsquo;t pay me for it again. Second, I&rsquo;ve listened to a few developers talk about the impact that having a free app has on the quality of reviews: there is no barrier to anyone downloading your app and leaving negative reviews without ever having tried it. In a paid tier, it means that people are more likely to actually try it before leaving feedback which, even if negative, is more likely to be something I can fix with updates (which I know, is having a bit more faith in &ldquo;People on the Internet&rdquo; than 20-ish years of online experience really merits).</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll continue to work on the features I didn&rsquo;t want to put into 1.0, try to be a better designer, and to start work on my next project which is aimed at something I&rsquo;m more familiar with: education.</p>
