I&rsquo;ve given Publii the boot and shifted this site to hugo. I myself got a gentler boot, being made redundant and so eyeing off what to do next.
2020, it&rsquo;s been quite a year
OK so it&rsquo;s actually 2024, but whilst migrating this site to Hugo I noticed I haven&rsquo;t written
anything for the last four years or so.
It isn&rsquo;t much of an excuse for the 2020 and 2021, but from 2022 I&rsquo;ve been out of the classroom,
working at a Digital Technologies EdTech platform. As such most of
the interesting stuff I worked on was either internal, and thus not really relevant to write
about, or external, and published as a course or delivered as part of a professional development
session, and so I didn&rsquo;t really feel like it was something to write about on my personal site.
I know that sort of excuse doesn&rsquo;t hold much water for lots of people who write about internal
work topics all the time, but it feels right to me.">
