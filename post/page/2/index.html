    <p>Testing out LDR sensors
This year I have been teaching robotics to Year 8s for the first time. I‚Äôve mainly been using BBC Micro:bits, since they are quite affordable, robust, are easy to hook up to a range of widely available components, and are easy to program in a few different environments (MicroPython being my weapon of choice).
To keep myself entertained, and to provide my students with a sample project (although more complex code-wise than they‚Äôre likely to accomplish) I decided to make something myself this term while my class worked on their own group projects (theirs are themed after the UN Global Goals). I had ideas for either building a carousel or a light gun game, and settled on the latter so I didn‚Äôt have to¬†also tackle 3D printing out cams and gears and the like.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This is the first year that Digital Technologies has been a mandatory part of the Australian curriculum through to Year 8. Whilst the subject area contains a number of different topics, the one that generally comes to mind (helped in no small part by our politicians and media üôÑ banging on about ‚Äòcoding‚Äô this, and ‚Äòcoding‚Äô that) is programming and algorithmic thinking.
Since our education sector has a fairly comprehensive set of licenses to all things Microsoft, we have Minecraft: Education Edition licenses for all of our students and staff. While I am not that big of a fan of Minecraft‚Äôs system of switches and redstone wiring (I prefer my programming higher level and less clunky), I do quite like plugging in external programming through Code Connection, as I‚Äôve written about before in toying with core sampling.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Background I‚Äôve been using Minecraft Education Edition with Code Connection in my Year 7 classes this term to teach programming principles, which has been a blast* (i.e. I spend a lot of time trying to encourage students to write programs rather than run around building stuff themselves).
The Agent
Code Connection comes with a ton of interesting tutorials to get started with, but I‚Äôve been writing a few things for myself to try out different features, two of which are the Agent and the Builder. The Agent is a code-controlled character that can build from its inventory, attack and destroy surrounding blocks, and do basic sensing of its environment. The builder is an invisible constructor which is used for raising structures fairly quickly; it doesn‚Äôt have an inventory and can‚Äôt interact with its environment beyond placing blocks.

    <p>I‚Äôve been getting a bit antsy about continuing to pay Squarespace to host Headtilt, mostly due to the infrequent updates that I seem to be doing over the last couple of years, and partly because I think I feel the need to tinker with stuff.
For ages I‚Äôve liked the idea of static site generators, and occasionally I‚Äôll go and play with one for a while before falling out of love with the idea of writing up posts in Markdown, having to remember its syntax for links, images, etc, and then go running back to the arms of a regular CMS.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Publii to Microblog
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>When deciding to play around with Publii (after taking a dislike to Jekyll, and not finding anything else that tickled my fancy), the first problem seemed to be that despite supporting tags for posts, there was no way to create an RSS or JSON feed based on a tag. Publii creates a feed, but it contains all posts regardless of the category.
Two alternatives presented themselves, neither particularly nice:
‚Äòhide‚Äô all posts except Microblog tagged posts from the feed. This is both kludgy, and not pleasant looking, since only Microblog posts would then appear on the front page of the site. Write a script to create a new feed from the main one with everything except Microblog tagged posts filtered out. Not very hard, but requires running the feed filter after each post.
This wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal if Publii followed most other static site generators in running with command-line scripts, since I could just add another script to the chain of posting, but since it all runs through a GUI program with a shiny ‚Äúsync changes‚Äù button, it means then manually (or on a schedule to check for changes with a cron job maybe) pulling the JSON feed, filtering posts, and then pushing the new file to the site again. (not a real option) figure out how to modify Publii to do what I wanted. Anyhow, I guess option 2 seems like the way to go since it‚Äôs gross but simple to do. If it turns out I care (or post!) enough, I‚Äôll automate it later.

    <p>Overview Part of the new Digital Technologies curriculum for year 7 and 8 involves students learning about wired and wireless networks, and methods of data transmission and security. There are activities from the Digital Technologies Learning Hub that deal with routing and issues with performance (that are pretty good unplugged activities). I use these or variations on these when I teach those concepts, but I wanted to put together something that actually involved technology in the classroom, and dealt with ideas a bit lower down the network stack.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The Backstory Before Christmas I was noodling around with Affinity Designer in an attempt to be a bit better at design. Part of this has been getting more familiar with the tools by working through a bunch of the tutorials at Tuts&#43;. Tuts&#43; hosts some tutorials aimed at Designer, but working through the ones aimed at other software like Illustrator has been an interesting exercise in figuring out Designer‚Äôs tools.
While I was making a robot face, I was trying to make wires by putting a gradient on a stroke, but it seems Designer won‚Äôt allow you to have a gradient which follows parallel to the stroke. Instead it will apply the gradient to the stroke colour in the same manner as filling.

    <p>After using the new MBP for a week, I‚Äôm coming to appreciate the apps that do a good job with their Touch Bar behaviour. I wrote about Affinity Designer before. Pixelmator uses a similar approach, although it seems to be a bit inconsistent, since it allows you to choose tools, but not all of them.
Pixelmator: Touch Bar tool options
The real heroes that I‚Äôve found so far are Terminal, Preview, and whatever the app is that takes screenshots behind the scenes based on ‚åò-Shift-3/4/6 keyboard shortcuts. The default (and optional) buttons for these mostly seem to have been provided to give actual value to a software button, rather than just be there to show that there‚Äôs support.
