Summary
The book covers the basics of pandas in a way that I felt was
generally easy to understand and absorb, particularly the first couple of chapters on Series
and DataFrames. The latter half of the book moves a bit more quickly than I would have liked.
Each exercise is a discussion of the topic, a set of worked steps and questions, and three or
so &ldquo;beyond the exercise&rdquo; questions to solve without the help of the book. There is a
GitHub repo
of notebooks containing all of the book code and the &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; solutions.">

  <div class="post-content"><p>The last couple of months I&rsquo;ve been working through <a href="https://lerner.co.il/">Reuven Lerner&rsquo;s</a>
<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/pandas-workout">Pandas Workout</a> book.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#summary">#</a></h2>
<p>The book covers the basics of <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> in a way that I felt was
generally easy to understand and absorb, particularly the first couple of chapters on Series
and DataFrames. The latter half of the book moves a bit more quickly than I would have liked.
Each exercise is a discussion of the topic, a set of worked steps and questions, and three or
so &ldquo;beyond the exercise&rdquo; questions to solve without the help of the book. There is a
<a href="https://github.com/reuven/pandas-workout">GitHub repo</a>
of notebooks containing all of the book code and the &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; solutions.</p>
<p>There are two &ldquo;projects&rdquo; built into the book at the halfway point and end which I like the
idea of, but were too heavily structured to be satisfying, and I think would have benefited
from less specific questions, and a sample solution.</p>
<p>For a book on data analysis, it can sometimes be inconsistent about discussing some of
the approaches and results in the exercises. Some of the results are well explained, but there
are many where only a technical solution is given, and since all of the data sets are real,
there&rsquo;s considerable nuance in understanding and interpreting some of the results.</p>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the book. My understanding of the &ldquo;pandas way&rdquo; has increased
considerably, and there were some good data sets provided (with some exceptions). Juggling
family obligations, Christmas/New Year etc, it took me a couple of months to work through it
all, which I felt wasn&rsquo;t too bad.</p>

    <div class="callout-content">
        <p>I bought this book through Apple Books which I don&rsquo;t recommend as it prevents you from copy
and pasting any content. Although I try not to copy/paste code since the whole point is building
up things like muscle memory and making the dumb syntax mistakes getting them out of my system,
there are a number of long column names in the data sets that I would have loved to copy and
paste before VSCode took over and let me autocomplete.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would buy a paper copy of a book like this, since there are lots of links to
documentation and examples, but having an eBook platform that was more permissive would have
been better. Chalk another one up to the hidden cost of easy purchasing.</p>

<h3 id="the-good">The good<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-good">#</a></h3>
<p>There were quite a few interesting data sets that needed some interpretation, cleaning, and
generally had a pretty realistic level of mess, extra data, etc to deal with. I think the standouts
amongst the data were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Open-Parking-and-Camera-Violations/nc67-uf89/about_data">NYC Parking violations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page">NYC Taxi trips</a></li>
<li><a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/school_scores/">US SAT data</a> (Original data may come <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/data_tables.asp">from here</a> but there&rsquo;s a lot there to sift through)</li>
</ul>
<p>These were messy, had lots of extra data to look at, and many different angles to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="the-not-so-good">The not so good<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-not-so-good">#</a></h3>
<p>The final project data on US universities was not terribly
compelling to me, even as an educator, and I found it aggregated away to the point of being
quite shallow.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data">Titanic data set</a> was, in my opinion,
a <em>terrible</em> choice. The fields were barely
explained in the book, and looking at other places that the data has been used like in various
Kaggle projects, no one seemed to have any good descriptions of most of the data set at all.
After some digging around
<a href="http://campus.lakeforest.edu/frank/FILES/MLFfiles/Bio150/Titanic/TitanicMETA.pdf">I found this</a>
which gave a decent account of the data. I found it <em>really</em> surprising that this data seemed
to be so popular without anyone trying to explain what was actually in it! This also led to
some pretty broad substitution of missing data that, to me, felt pretty transformative rather
than interpretive.</p>
<h2 id="depth">Depth<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#depth">#</a></h2>
<p>As I said in the summary, the first couple of chapters were really good, providing what I felt
was a solid basis for understanding much of the rest of the book effectively. In terms of overall
topics, the book has a good progression from the basics of pandas, cleaning data, analysis,
visualisation, and performance. Some are glossed over more than others, but there&rsquo;s enough to
get a get an idea of what pandas does, and where you might want to reach for other tools like
Seaborn.</p>
<p>Where the depth wasn&rsquo;t really sufficient was where technical understanding and reasoning and
interpretation were equally important. I think there were several examples throughout the book
where cleaning decisions were made without a good discussion of the implications it had on
interpreting the results.</p>
<h2 id="gripes">Gripes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#gripes">#</a></h2>
<p>To be clear, I quite liked the book and don&rsquo;t regret buying it or the time invested in going
through all of the exercises, but there were some annoyances along the way I could have done
without:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quite a few <strong>Beyond the Exercise</strong> problems had discrepancies between what the book said
and what the code in the repo actually did. Some of this might be reconciling edits of
various versions of the book, but in the cases I noticed the question, the code, and the
results were in the notebook in the repo.</li>
<li>There were a number of examples of questions where the wording was ambiguous enough that
I had to look at the either the worked example in the book or the solution in the repo to
understand what was being asked. This was frustrating since I wanted to test my understanding
of the techniques.</li>
<li>Some of the <strong>Beyond the Exercise</strong> questions involved techniques not covered in the book
without any links to relevant documentation. The pandas docs aren&rsquo;t too bad, but are fairly
terse and technical, and if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re looking for it doesn&rsquo;t help much.
LLMs like Copilot are more help since they do better at interpreting <em>intent</em>, but suffer
from all the LLM issues like offering up code for older versions, consistently offering the
same wrong answers, or providing example data with the code that doesn&rsquo;t demonstrate the
differences that were being described.</li>
</ul>
