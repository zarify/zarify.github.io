This means that the data connection on the phone dropped out several times along most of our trips.</p><p>Usually what this results in is the helpful voice reverting to a "in 100 metres turn left" instead of "in 100 metres turn left onto towards " or similar. Instead (and I mainly remember this happening with Google Maps) we got several phantom roundabouts. We would be driving through the countryside without a roundabout in sight, and Google would chirpily inform us that at the upcoming roundabout, take the second exit. This happened several times, interspersed with the actual directions to the location which we were heading to.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 18, 2018</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://headtilt.me/wag/ramble/">ramble</a></li></ul></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://headtilt.me/naturally/" class="inverse" rel="prev">Naturally...</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://headtilt.me/the-future/" class="inverse" rel="next">The...
