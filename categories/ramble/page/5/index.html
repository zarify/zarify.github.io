    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Wired made a post in which the publication outlines what it is going to do about the ad-blocking situation. They acknowledge that readers either want to view content without all the cruft, or are concerned about the fact that advertising is as much about tracking as about actually putting ads in front of your eyeballs.
They are moving to restrict articles from those who use ad blockers, with the promise to visitors that if they whitelist the site in their ad blockers they will only see “standard display advertising”. Of course they don’t say what “standard display advertising” actually means to them. I suspect it just means that they will choose to serve ads that are not visually intrusive (e.g. Popovers, popunders, interstitials etc), and fine, that can appeal to their first group of readers who only care about not having lots of rubbish shoved in their face while they are trying to read. The issue is that they specifically point out that some people are very uncomfortable with the amount of tracking that goes on by advertisers, nothing is said about choosing advertisers based on their privacy policies.

    <p>As usual to keep myself sane during the Summer holidays I’ve been doing some coding on project ideas that have come up over the year. After over a year or so of tinkering I’m starting to feel like I’m getting the hang of the way that iOS does things with MVC (although I still have trouble reading Apple’s documentation), and these holidays I think I finally got something useful finished which I might get around to publishing.

    <p>I started writing the draft for this post back in December after attending a conference called Switching Tracks, which seemed to focus a lot on gamification and flipped learning approaches to education. As is usual at conferences these days part of the keynote introduction was what Twitter hashtag to use for the back channel conversation.
I’m not sure what this sort of conversation is like at other events, since I mostly attend education-themed stuff, but it usually runs something like this:

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There has been a bunch of fuming about the web recently about the rumor of Apple removing the 3.5mm headphone jack from the next iteration of the iPhone (and presumably everything else). All of the complaints that I’ve seen so far have been of the “isn’t it thin enough already?!” variety, which I feel misses a broader issue. There seems to be an assumption that everything that Apple does to the iPhone these days is in service to making it thinner and lighter, and I guess when you look at it, the 3.5mm port and associated internal hardware is the (very small) elephant in the room. ...</p>

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I forgot to put this into the previous post about content blocking.
I was at a teacher networking meeting a couple of months ago and we had some Apple folks down to talk about education. They were looking at some of the stuff coming up in iOS 9, and mentioned content blocking. Through reading and listening to followup from WWDC this year, most people had put this squarely into an ad-blocking context, but the way they were talking about it sounded a lot more like it would be usful in an instututional setting where acceptable use policies would dictate that some content be inaccessible (e.g. the myriad of stuff which educational organisations block because they are “thinking of the children!”).

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Content Blocking
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>First of all, content blocking in iOS has a ways to go. It works in Safari and Safari View Controllers, and since as far as I know these new view controllers only got added this year, most apps which use web content won’t be using them and thus won’t be filtered by blockers. Since most of the web content I consume comes via RSS readers and social media apps like Twitter, Facebook and Google&#43; the content isn’t filtered until they decide they want to adopt the new controllers (if they ever do). I don’t really want to push every web link out to Safari because of the overhead of then having to deal with tab management instead of just reading and swiping backwards or tapping the close button to return to a feed. ...</p>

This is going to be one of the rare times I write about education, but also technology. As a teacher, it can be quite difficult to get out of the rut of doing the same old thing. Pressures from trying to cover everything in the curriculum, making lessons accessible to a variety of types of learners, looking for new ideas from behind a bunch of marking, the need to keep parity with other classes so that assessments are relatively manageable to organize and consistent; basically planning for new things can be a struggle.

    <p>Since I got one of the original Pebbles which came out as a Kickstarter project I’ve been interested in the smart watch movement. Pebble did a lot of things really well (which I’ll look at shortly) despite the limitations placed upon them by the platform I was interested in (iOS). Since then (and probably prior to as well) there have been a slew of different devices which integrate with your phone. Broadly I think these fit into a couple of categories: fitness tracking, and phone interaction.

    <p>I got a RaspberryPi recently and have been wondering what to do with it.
After looking at the comments of a recent HN post on making a magic mirror out of an old Nexus tablet, there was a link to Jasper, a voice control platform made for a Pi.
I’m kinda keen on doing something similar now (“Mirror Mirror on the wall… what’s the forecast for this evening?”). I think the issues are going to be how to keep it as low profile as possible, and to reduce power consumption. There were a few suggestions of full size monitors to put behind a two way mirror in the comments, but those tend to be pretty thick and chew up quite a bit of power. Some of the modular displays for things like the Pi seem like a better idea, and having them tied to something like Jasper for activation, rather than being on all the time could further cut down on the usage.
