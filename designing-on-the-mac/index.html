Later in the year it popped up in the Mac App Store on sale (at I think around $80AUD for both) so as an impulse buy, I got both of them (and again, quietly forgot about it).\nI noticed that through the year that Serif had picked up Apple Design Awards for them, and during the holidays I figured I’d have a go at using them for asset production for my iOS project. After the usual “hey this isn’t where Adobe put things” problem (which I’m sure anyone who uses GIMP can sympathise with) I have to say that for someone like me who only needs a small subset of what the Adobe products can do, but more than what programs like Acorn and Pixelmator do (although Pixelmator is actually pretty damned good), Photo and Designer are both quite powerful and more importantly really easy to use. In particular, Designer’s path editing feels streets ahead of Illustrator for drawing, combining and modifying paths.\nAt the end of the day, I’m still not a very good designer, but it’s nice to have affordable tools that don’t get in my way.\n",
