The students quite enjoyed it and it was a nice excuse to get out of the classroom.\n2020 has been the year of living with the global SARS-CoV2 pandemic, and there has been a lot of discussion about the various contact tracing apps which have been developed left and right (which is great fuel for my classes on ethics and data privacy!) and I figured I’d spin up a new idea for the activity on wireless networks and flip the contact tracing app on its head, using it to infect other devices instead of keep records of potentially risky contact.\nThe basic concept of the contact tracing apps (at least of the moderately sane variety) is this:\nBroadcast an ID (often randomised) via Bluetooth Low Energy Monitor incoming beacon messages, and use the signal to determine approximate proximity and whether this falls within the threshhold of $DANGER_DISTANCE Keep a record of IDs which have been in proximity for $DANGER_TIME IDs are purged after some time period (21 days is thrown around a lot) which would cover the time taken to typically develop symptoms In the event of someone testing positive for COVID-19 contacts could be uploaded to local health services to enable more efficient contact tracing (with the method for this varying by implementation) The typical values for $DANGER_DISTANCE and $DANGER_TIME have been around 2 meters and 15 minutes respectively.\nUsing Micro:bits Since the Micro:bit has a Bluetooth radio and can easily monitor signal strength and signal device IDs, it was fairly straightforward to implement some code (written in Microsoft’s MakeCode this time, whereas I used Python for the PKE meter).\nI’d like to do up a version of this that uses a speaker as well for some audio feedback about symptom status - some bleeps and bloops for coughing perhaps, or even just for some basic tactile feedback of vibration from a piezo to alert students that their device is sick.\nI’ve included links to the code and discussion of the algorithm further down the page.\nVideo Here’s a video of my first test run of more than a pair of clients.

Each incoming message also contains the device ID of the sender, which can be used for determining whether enough infection messages have been received to merit being infected itself.\nIf sufficient time (40s in this case) passes without enough infection messages from a seen device, that device’s info is purged from the lists. This has a couple of purposes:\nIt keeps the idea of device lists easier to understand - if it’s there it’s infectious and close enough to be a problem If it isn’t there, we’re preserving that device’s privacy by not keeping its info on our device When devices are infected, they remain asymptomatic for 60 seconds, so only show the sad face on the screen after they’ve been merrily infecting other close devices for some time. The client needs to maintain arrays of other devices it has seen which are broadcasting infected messages, when it first saw an infected device, and how many messages it has seen. It also needs to know if it is infectious and displaying symptoms.\nThe clients broadcast discovery messages intended for the master device. If they are infected, they broadcast infect messages, and use the screen to displays whether or not they are symptomatic. Contacts are also pruned when they fall out of range for the infection window.\nWhen radio packets are received, the client needs to determine if the device has been seen before, if the signal is strong enough to merit contributing to infection, and whether enough contact has occured to infect this device. This also listens for the master device to see if an infection message refers to this device ID.\nI could probably get away without pruning and just maintain data for every device seen, but this keeps the list of infected devices easy to understand. If it’s in the array, it’s something to worry about. This also stays true to the idea of not keeping identifying data for devices which are not relevant.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Last year when looking at wireless concepts with my Year 8 Digital Technologies students, I wrote a program for wireless beacons and laser cut a <a href="/dowsing-for-radio/">Ghostbusters style PKE Meter</a> with some servos and a RGB LED for students to go on a hunt in our library. It was a good opportunity to look at things like the range of wireless signals, interference due to obstruction of different materials, and noisy broadcast channels.

<p>2020 has been the year of living with the global SARS-CoV2 pandemic, and there has been a lot of discussion about the various contact tracing apps which have been developed left and right (which is great fuel for my classes on ethics and data privacy!) and I figured I&rsquo;d spin up a new idea for the activity on wireless networks and flip the contact tracing app on its head, using it to infect other devices instead of keep records of potentially risky contact.</p>
<p>The basic concept of the contact tracing apps (at least of the moderately sane variety) is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadcast an ID (often randomised) via Bluetooth Low Energy</li>
<li>Monitor incoming beacon messages, and use the signal to determine approximate proximity and whether this falls within the threshhold of $DANGER_DISTANCE</li>
<li>Keep a record of IDs which have been in proximity for $DANGER_TIME</li>
<li>IDs are purged after some time period (21 days is thrown around a lot) which would cover the time taken to typically develop symptoms</li>
<li>In the event of someone testing positive for COVID-19 contacts could be uploaded to local health services to enable more efficient contact tracing (with the method for this varying by implementation)</li>
</ul>
<p>The typical values for $DANGER_DISTANCE and $DANGER_TIME have been around 2 meters and 15 minutes respectively.</p>
