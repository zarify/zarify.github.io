<h3 id="student-verification-codes">Student verification codes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#student-verification-codes">#</a></h3>
<p>Although this is designed to be a tool predominately used by students, I&rsquo;m a teacher,
and having some feedback from students about whether they have successfully completed
a problem scenario is a nice to have. But how do we do this in an environment specifically
designed to not require any server infrastructure?</p>
<p>The answer is obviously hashing! So I added an optional student identifier to the UI, and
when all the tests have been passed, if there is an identifier present, the student gets
presented with a human-speakable code (two words and a number) that is built from a hash
of the test suite, the day they ran the tests, and their student identifier.</p>
<p>In the authoring interface, the teacher can enter any number of student identifiers, and
will be shown the current verification codes for the problem config that has been loaded.
This obviously doesn&rsquo;t give the teacher any idea of <em>how</em> the student has solved the
problem, but it&rsquo;s a lightweight first step in a conversation.</p>
<h3 id="authoring-improvements">Authoring improvements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#authoring-improvements">#</a></h3>
<p>There were a few improvements to the authoring page this week, mostly focused on making
tests and feedback easier to author and more flexible.</p>
<ul>
<li>AST rules now have some light syntax checking of the rules, so will present an error
and prevent saving if the expression is invalid or only <em>truthy</em> rather than a true boolean</li>
<li>Additional files can be added to tests that override the user workspace, so allow for
checks against hard-coded results of file use problems</li>
<li>An option for partial or full string matches in feedback and tests was added to make
it easier to write more flexible or strict feedback and test rules</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="read-only-file-support">Read-only file support<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#read-only-file-support">#</a></h3>
<p>I added support for read-only (protected) files into the user workspace and wow did the
agent ever have a hard time with this one. Files can be marked as <em>read-only</em> in authoring
which both prevents the user from writing to them and also prevents deletion through the UI
as well as with user code.</p>
<p>This is where I really started to run into some of the issues with using a client-side
approach using Micropython. The two bundled ideas in this feature were file permissions
and file ownership, both wrapped in a virtual filesystem bundle, trying to isolate
authorship and userland code all on the user&rsquo;s device.</p>

        <span>Rabbit holes ahoy!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="admonition-content">
        <p>This feature came with another exciting rabbit hole. When I was testing whether files had
actually been deleted (reconciling the tabbed file UI with the virtual filesystem that
Micropython accesses) I ran into an issue where an <code>os.listdir()</code> was taking <strong>7 seconds</strong>
to run. It turns out the agent had added a boatload of system tracing into the code and
so something simple like &ldquo;what are the files please?&rdquo; turned into an insane mess of checks
and conditional console output.</p>
      </div>
    </div><h3 id="micropythons-edges">Micropython&rsquo;s edges<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#micropythons-edges">#</a></h3>
<p>As I write more testing code, and put the (hopefully final) set of features into user
workspaces and the authoring interface, it&rsquo;s starting to become apparent where the hard
edges are in using Micropython instead of something like Pyodide.</p>
<p>Error handling is something that Micropython does a bit differently. It doesn&rsquo;t come
with the lovely expansive tracebacks of regular Python (that&rsquo;s been improved so much in
the last couple of major versions), and so there&rsquo;s a bit of a divergence between what
the student would see running their code in this app vs in a desktop version when things
go wrong.</p>

        <span>Python or Programming?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="admonition-content">
        <p>Part of me wonders how much this is an actual problem however. As a teacher who has used
Python for over 15 years now, particularly in days of yore when the popular programming
languages in schools tended to be things like Visual Basic, I often think about whether
it matters if we&rsquo;re &ldquo;teaching Python&rdquo; or &ldquo;teaching programming&rdquo;, particularly as features
like the walrus operator come out that have the potential to change the way we think
about how control flow is written in the language.</p>
      </div>
    </div><p>The other edge I&rsquo;m starting to run into as I build out a library of test configurations
is modules and the standard library. A really common library to use with students is CSV.
There are lots of examples of CSV data out there, and it&rsquo;s convenient to export from
spreadsheets and then use with code. However, CSV isn&rsquo;t part of the Micropython stdlib.</p>
<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t be such a problem if CSV wasn&rsquo;t such a hot mess in terms of edge cases
and we could do simple parsing, but sadly that isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>

      <div class="admonition-content">
        <p>I&rsquo;m squinting at Pyodide and starting to wonder how much more involved it will be
building the same sort of support for the async JS-based workflow I&rsquo;ve got going
here with Micropython, or whether there&rsquo;s a better solution with full-fat Python.
(Ideally a better solution that doesn&rsquo;t involve completely rewriting the whole app!)</p>

<p>Back when I started this project everything was being written into one big <code>main.js</code>
file. Even after the first couple of working features appeared, this grew into something
like 3000 lines of JS, and this was the point where it became really obvious that
unless it got split out into feature-based files it would be completely unmaintainable
(particularly for the agent, which has really struggled with larger files).</p>
<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve been watching each of the modules getting bigger and bigger. Doing
the refactor of the main file was horrible, and had a couple of false starts while I
figured out a way of getting the agent to tackle the problem in a good way that didn&rsquo;t
get it stuck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m peeking around my fingers at a time in the not-too-distant future when I&rsquo;m going
to start paying attention to just what is in those modules, since I got a bit of a
look when trying to get to the bottom of the issues with the read-only file feature
this week, and the amount of duplicate code, debugging code that&rsquo;s been gated behind
flags, etc. Slimming things down once things are &ldquo;complete&rdquo; is going to be a ride.</p>
