What we had before
The outcome of the previous week&rsquo;s achievements was pretty satisfying since I&rsquo;d tried
and failed to solve the problems of having a responsive WASM Python runtime for user
code before. Being able to lean on the agent to do things like make changes to C code
where I knew what the outcome needed to be, and knew how it needed to work, but didn&rsquo;t
know what to do to make it happen was so valuable.">

<h2 id="what-we-had-before">What we had before<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-we-had-before">#</a></h2>
<p>The outcome of the previous week&rsquo;s achievements was pretty satisfying since I&rsquo;d tried
and failed to solve the problems of having a responsive WASM Python runtime for user
code before. Being able to lean on the agent to do things like make changes to C code
where I knew what the outcome needed to be, and knew <em>how</em> it needed to work, but didn&rsquo;t
know <em>what</em> to do to make it happen was so valuable.</p>
<p>By the end of it I had a Micropython runtime running client side and being able to write,
execute, and interrupt user code. I still have a nagging feeling that there will be some
edge cases to discover where everything will break horribly and we&rsquo;ll be diving back into
compiling C code again, but for now it&rsquo;s just a feeling. I have a virtual filesystem that
the Python code can access, and a basic snapshot system for version control. Finally, I had
a configuration system where scenarios could be loaded into the browser with instructions,
starter code, and live pattern-based feedback for code as well as IO.</p>
<h2 id="whats-happened-since">What&rsquo;s happened since<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#whats-happened-since">#</a></h2>
<p>On my list of priorities for the next features to implement were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit tests for user code so program behaviour can be verified against the instructions</li>
<li>A configuration authoring interface so I didn&rsquo;t have to write JSON all the time</li>
<li>Methods for loading configurations into the page</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing has been a bit of a ride. To start with I wanted to re-use the same Python runtime
as the user code to run the tests, but I ran into way too many issues with state, rewiring
<code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>, and <code>stderr</code> so that it was only visible to tests, and just plain implementation
issues, so a couple of reverts later, I went with firing up another runtime in an iframe
and just doing the testing there, passing info back to the main page.</p>

        <span>When is an <code>input</code> not an <code>input</code>?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="admonition-content">
        <p>So I know I <em>said</em> something about rewiring things like <code>stderr</code> and <code>stdout</code> but actually
that turned out to be such a mess that actually what I did was just treat it all as <code>stdout</code>
and do some pattern matching for tracebacks. I&rsquo;m not proud.</p>
<p>Who knows, this could be an opportunity later on to just compile something into the runtime
to make it easier. After all, one of my main realisations from the previous lof of work was
that it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the original Python was <em>meant</em> to do, it only matters whether
it looks like it&rsquo;s doing it to the user, and if their code is implemented in a real runtime
it does the same thing.</p>
      </div>
    </div><p>So far I&rsquo;ve implemented testing for <code>stdout</code>, <code>stdin</code>, and <code>stderr</code>. This is all focused on
program behaviour, not implementation. Down the road I want to implement richer testing of
the program internals.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things about doing the tests for <code>stdin</code> was again a difference in
how the user-facing code works compared to the testing framework. User code is interactive -
one of the frustrating things about working with the agent was it kept suggesting just
pre-collecting user input, shattering the illusion of interactive code (and also ignoring
the problems caused by non-deterministic inputs, such as in a while loop). With tests, we
can quite happily just build an input queue and feed the program as required.</p>
<p>I need to do some more rigorous tests of behaviour with mismatched inputs and expected inputs
since for now there&rsquo;s a bunch of ignoring of inconvenient things going on.</p>
<h3 id="these-are-no-spaces-for-braces">These are no spaces for braces<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#these-are-no-spaces-for-braces">#</a></h3>
<p>JSON is supposed to be human readable, which it is (mostly). However it is so not human
writeable. Since the configuration for problems is done in JSON I wanted to have an authoring
tool to create the JSON files, prevent dumb errors, provide documentation, and so on.</p>
<p>This was handled by the agent pretty well after writing up a spec document and getting it
to identify gaps in requirements.</p>
<p>The outcome was a separate page that allows for configuration metadata, writing instructions,
building feedback, and writing tests. The latest configuration is saved and loaded from
browser <code>localStorage</code>, which has a nice side benefit of providing that as a data source
when loading in the main page. It has a pretty pleasant flow of: edit config, switch to the
app page, load the latest config automatically, run tests or feedback, and repeat. When I&rsquo;m
happy I can export to a JSON file. I haven&rsquo;t implemented it yet, but the plan is also to keep
configs as a more easily accessed list in IndexedDB so that if you&rsquo;re developing on the same
machine there&rsquo;s a lower friction way of editing configs over time.</p>
<h3 id="but-teacher-what-am-i-meant-to-do">But teacher, what am I meant to do?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#but-teacher-what-am-i-meant-to-do">#</a></h3>
<p>When developing I have a few sample configurations sitting in a sub folder of the app so I
can test various features, but if this is going to be something for people who are not me
to use, I wanted to provide some flexible methods of loading configuration information.</p>
<p>I landed on a few different methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual loading based off files stored with the app (not user friendly but easy for testing).</li>
<li>Loading an authoring config file from localStorage (see previous section). Only for authoring testing.</li>
<li>Upload a file manually (open a JSON config). Not very student friendly.</li>
<li>Load from a URL parameter, either providing a file name (load from the config store) or a full URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is much more user friendly - a teacher could just provide a link in an email, LMS, etc
and the page would automatically load the config that was specified. The problem is one I&rsquo;ve
run into a fair bit when developing this - what about server settings? To load the file from
another site, it needs to allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. From what I gather, this would
require someone to host and access their resource files through something like GitHub using
the <code>raw.githubuserconent.com</code> method.</p>
<p>None of these methods are amazing, but again given the constraints of &ldquo;hosted on a vanilla
HTTP server with no special configuration&rdquo; I think it&rsquo;s about the best I can do, so all of them
are implemented.</p>
<h2 id="introspection">Introspection<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introspection">#</a></h2>
<p>This stage of the process has highlighted some interesting aspects of the agent workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like I&rsquo;m playing this weird hybrid role of product manager and tester.</li>
<li>Ran out of the credits provided as part of my Copilot subscription part-way through the week, which cut off Claude, so I&rsquo;ve mostly been working with GPT-5-mini. The difference in &ldquo;AI-ality&rdquo; (not &ldquo;person&quot;ality,surely!) is striking.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s been a real difference in speed of development vs perceived speed of development this week, since a lot of it has been UI code, but a lot of it has also been fixing regressions (so many regressions).</li>
<li>Testing (lots of plain JS and Playwright) has been interesting. One thing I&rsquo;ve really not been enjoying is the feeling that instead of just running the tests myself, I should be <em>asking the agent to run the tests</em> because then it pays attention to the test output. This is super frustrating, and I&rsquo;ve found that as I go on I&rsquo;ve been trying to be more involved in the code myself because the alternave is so incredibly wasteful in terms of time and resources.</li>
</ul>
