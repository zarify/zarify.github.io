            "content_html": "<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d823l01t0\">Motivation</h2>\n<p>This term I've been working through Data Representation and some Networks concepts with my Year 8 students. I used Micro:bits extensively for both aspects of this for the hands-on approach and ready access to simple networking code. To finish off the term, after looking at things like network latency, I thought it'd be fun to do an activity built around attenuation of wireless signals.</p>\n<p>Previously I've had students group up in pairs and have the Micro:bits send an image back and forth pixel by pixel. This allows for students to see when messages have not arrived as they will have missing pixels from their displays.</p>\n<p>This year, coming up to Easter I thought I'd do an egg hunt by measuring signal strength of \"beacon\" Micro:bits and using different methods to relay that to the user of a detector Micro:bit. I've been meaning to do this sort of activity for a while after seeing the <a href=\"https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/hot-or-cold\">Hot or Cold</a> activity.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">I think it would be interesting to do an orienteering activity based on this at some point where students could have their Micro:bit collect data on the beacons they have found and report back for scoring at the end. I'm keeping this idea for our next orientation day activity with our incoming Year 6 students.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d8q1acsb0\"> Physical Design</h2>\n<p>The beacon itself is just a Micro:bit powered by a battery periodically broadcasting a message. The only interesting thing I incorporated into the beacon is being able to change the signal strength so that some beacons are easier to find than others. I found that a strength between 0 and 3 was pretty good for what I wanted.</p>\n<p>My initial designs for the detector simply used a horizontal line on the Micro:bit screen which moved up or down depending on the strength of received messages. It worked fine in a utilitarian kind of way, and since I only have so much space to store bigger housings, most students would use something like this.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--right\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/76/pke_meter_by_teletran.jpg\" alt=\"PKE Meter - Teletran@Deviantart\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\">\n<figcaption >PKE Meter design created by <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/teletran/art/PKE-meter-163025300\">Teletran (Deviantart)</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>However, in the spirit of cheesy sci-fi I wanted to build a hand-held detector that had glowy lights and moving parts. Although I didn't recognise it at the time, what I had in my head was the Psycho-Kinetic Energy (P.K.E.) Meter from Ghost Busters.</p>\n<p>Although I initially wanted to have acrylic arms which could be bottom-lit using RGB LEDs, I ended up just using MDF parts, and embedding a single RGB LED in the face of the housing. If I revisit the design later on I'll see about making a fancier version, but I ran out of prototyping time for this design.</p>\n<p>I used a cheap USB power bank for the power supply, and the excellent DFRobot Micro:mate to break out the pins for my LED and servos. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/76/gallery/IMG_2248.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/76/gallery/IMG_2248-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Low signal\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Low signal</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/76/gallery/IMG_2249.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/76/gallery/IMG_2249-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Medium signal\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Medium signal</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/76/gallery/IMG_2250.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/76/gallery/IMG_2250-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Strong signal\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Strong signal</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d823l48k2\">Technical Stuff</h2>\n<p>The signal strength (RSSI, measured in dBm) theoretically is measured from -255 to 0, with 0 being the strongest. In my testing however, I rarely saw values outside of -30 to -100, so when converting the received signal strength into a percentage for use as an angle and hue, any readings outside of this space got compressed to the extremes.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">\n  rssi = abs(rssi) - 30\n  if rssi &lt; 0:\n      rssi = 0\n  elif rssi &gt; 70:\n      rssi = 70\n  perc = rssi / 70\n  </code></pre>\n<p>Signal readings were incredibly spiky taking only one reading at a time, so I tried out a rolling average which worked OK at 10 readings, and significantly better at 25 readings (with a 50ms delay between each reading). It introduced a delay in displaying signal readings, but stopping the jerky behaviour of the servos and flashing of the LED indicators was worth it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">\n  last = []\n  keep_last = 25 # how long the rolling average should be\n  ...\n  last.append(perc)\n  if len(last) &gt; keep_last:\n      del last[0]\n  perc_avg = sum(last) / len(last)\n  </code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d823l7nd3\">Review</h2>\n<p>Short range radio strength is quite finnicky, and so no matter how much fiddling I do with the code it will never work exactly how I want it due to interference, the direction of the antennas, and what I had for breakfast. However, I think the finished product works passably well, the physical design for the housing gives it a nice theatrical (if boxy) air, and it's a fun activity for the kids to do while learning about some of the properties of wireless communication.</p>\n<p>If anyone is interested in the code or laser cut designs, they are in my <a href=\"https://github.com/zarify/microbit/tree/master/Radio_Dowsing\">Microbit Github repo</a> along with the other things I make.</p>\n<p>I got to test this out with one of my Year 8 classes before school broke up for the holidays, hiding seven beacons behind books in our library and giving teams of three students a detector for each student, the short author code of the book each beacon was behind, and five minutes to match the books up with their title or the Dewey number. They all had a blast so this will definitely be on my list of things to do later on as an engagement activity (even through we didn't have the time to really dig into the details before break).</p>\n<p> <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"1138\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/331371137\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" ></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/331371137\">Radio Dowsing with Micro:bit</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user57535714\">Rob Poulter</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d7o1qhd30\">Motivation</h2>\n<p>Ever since I bought some of <a href=\"https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5624-move-mini-buggy-kit-excl-microbit.html\">Kitronik's :move buggies</a> I've been interested in making robots with the Micro:bit. They're simple to program, have a decent set of features, and the kids enjoy using them. However they're also a royal pain to assemble due to fiddly screw locations, quite expensive for what they are (we pay around $60AUD for what amounts to about $15-20AUD in components), and difficult to add on to due to cutting you off from all the additional pins the Micro:bit has to offer.</p>\n<p>This year I looked into alternatives. There some 3D printed designs on Thingiverse which also use the same <a href=\"https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5623-servolite-board-for-move-mini.html\">servo:lite board</a>, but are much easier to assemble (<a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2534232\">design 1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2485069\">design 2</a>), but my main issue with 3D printing is how long it takes.</p>\n<p>I found an interesting <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2746171\">stick insect design</a> which looked like it would lend itself to laser cutting instead and as a bonus didn't use continuous rotation servos, and so my Year 9 class put together a few and had a go at writing some code to get them to move. Although they looked promising for simple linear movement, the added weight of using MDF instead of ABS/PLA meant they were not very successful, and traction was an issue, so we chalked it up to a learning experience, fiddled with LED code on the servo:lite boards, and practiced writing remote control code with the Micro:bit radios instead.</p>\n<p>I liked the idea of using standard servos instead of continuous rotation (because they're cheap!) so I sat down to design my own robot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d7o2isbv1\">Design</h2>\n<p>Although I did technical drawing aeons ago at school, drafting is not really my strong suit (if I indeed have a strong suit). I drew up some rough plans, mostly while waiting for meetings to start.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/75//gallery/IMG_2191.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/75//gallery/IMG_2191-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Linear actuator design\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Linear actuator design</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/75//gallery/IMG_2192.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/75//gallery/IMG_2192-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Motion ideas for linear movement\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Motion ideas for linear movement</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/75//gallery/IMG_2193.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/75//gallery/IMG_2193-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Ideas about elevation and steering\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Ideas about elevation and steering</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/75//gallery/IMG_2194.jpg\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/75//gallery/IMG_2194-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Closing in on the final design\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Closing in on the final design</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>I started from my <a href=\"https://github.com/zarify/microbit/tree/master/Linear_Actuator\">linear actuator designs</a>, since there would need to be some linear movement - I initially imagined it as a pair of geared pontoons with a lifter underneath the robot, and played around with some ideas of having the lifter rotate so that the robot could steer. Although I still like this idea, keeping the cabling free and the interior robot layout nixed that idea and I went for a more traditional 'wheel' approach, each driven by a servo, and having a third servo to elevate the body so that the wheels could reset.</p>\n<p>The final design went through about six iterations due to issues with weight distribution of the mobile phone power bank I wanted to use for a battery and also the fiddliness of aligning the actuator rod and installing guides so that it moved in a straight line and didn't catch on the edges of the slot.</p>\n<p>Keeping the actuator rod running smoothly up and down without catching on any other part of the chassis was the hardest part of the design, and the trickiest to assemble once it was cut out. I originally had three pieces surrounding the rod which each had to fit into holes in the top and bottom plates, and it was incredibly difficult to align while also keeping the servos and rod in place. I ended up scrapping that design and going for a simple two support design instead. Utilising a cross shaped support for the actuator rod instead of an L shape also made building supports a lot easier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d7o35njn3\">Assembly</h2>\n<p>Here's a step-by-step process for assembly of the robot.</p>\n<p>The main problem areas are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting the actuator rod height right as you assemble, since it needs to be taken apart to adjust it. My guide for this is set the gear servo to 60 degrees before insertion, then insert the rod so that it is about 3mm below the top plate, using the guides which surround the rod as a, well, guide.</li>\n<li>Holding the whole thing together while the top plate is attached can be a challenge, as can aligning the guide rods. The servos hold the top plate roughly in place, so you can poke a finger or some small object in to push the tops of the guides into their holes to snap into place.</li>\n<li>Align the wheel servos to their forward positions before attaching the wheels. I use 110 degrees for the right, and 40 degrees for the left servos (since my cheap servos have some funny working ranges).</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a

Rather than dealing with real voltages, this is mapped to a range of integers. For the Micro:bit this is from 0-1023 (a 10 bit binary number) although you can customise this width for other platforms (such as the ESP32). Examples of analog input devices are light dependent resistors.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info msg--success\">One of the ah-ha moments I had was realising that these numbers being received from analog sensors didn't have any special meaning, and there was some analsys required to relate the amounts being reported to some real world information.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/72/water-815475_1280.jpg\" alt=\"Water partially being restricted\" width=\"788\" height=\"788\">\n<figcaption >An analog signal can be part of the whole potential signal.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> Analog output with Micro:bits is done via Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) rather than by changing the voltage directly. What this means is that the Micro:bit splits its output into small slices of time, and turns the pin to high voltage for enough of each slice to average out the power to the desired amount (called a duty cycle). This works fine with some components, but not others which expect continuous power.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">The <a href=\"https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pin.html#pulse-width-modulation\">MicroPython documentation on PWM</a> has some good information and diagrams.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/72/sprinkler-1209900_1280.jpg\" alt=\"This sprinkler puts out some water in bursts.\" width=\"687\" height=\"687\">\n<figcaption >This sprinkler puts out bursts of water as it cycles.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d0r6hfsud\"> Components</h2>\n<p>All of these components can be sourced cheaply from China; I tend to buy most of my gear through AliExpress. You can buy the same things (often attached to fancier addon boards) from the hobby/education sites, but usually at a very significant markup, which is not really workable when I often want to build custom projects that are heavy on the hot glue and solder.</p>\n<p>Most of these are pretty simple, but a few like the infrared sensors aren't just the basic sensor.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>Common Ground</strong><br><br>One of the things that took me a while to figure out (because in general I have been figuring things out as I go) is when using different power sources for higher power components such as the LED strips and servos, the ground pins of the Micro:bit and the extra power source need to be connected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d0qkaptu1\">Light Dependent Resistors (LDR)</h3>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--right\" src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/72/ldr-resistor-40611_1280.png\" alt=\"Light Dependent Resistor\" width=\"174\" height=\"300\">LDRs are brilliant simple little sensors. You pass power through them, and they change the their resistance depending on how much light is being shone on them. When reading analog data from the LDR, the intensity maps to the number recorded. Although they're pretty consistent, I've had some LDRs from the same batch report slightly different numbers, so it's worthwhile doing some calibration before use.</p>\n<p>Wiring is pretty straightforward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One leg is connected to voltage</li>\n<li>The other leg is connected to both a resistor (10kOhm) going to ground, and to a data pin on the Micro:bit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detect whether a door has been opened.</li>\n<li>Turn on/off lights based on ambient light level (digital behaviour) or change light brightness or colour (analog behaviour).</li>\n<li>Sensors for 'light guns' (see my <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/74\">haunted house project</a>).</li>\n<li>Particlulate sensor for liquids (shine a known intensity light through sample, detect amount that gets through).</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">I've been meaning to have a go at building a sun tracker using a series of LDRs set into the rim of a disk mounted on a servo, potentially for adjusting a solar panel to follow the sun.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d0qkata92\"><img class=\"post__image--right\" src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/72/led-1715226_1280.png\" alt=\"Light Emitting Diodes\" width=\"141\" height=\"300\">Light Emitting Diodes (LED)</h3>\n<p>LEDs come in a few different flavours. Typically the vanilla LEDs will come in several different colours (while, blue, yellow, orange, red and green) and a couple of different sizes (5mm and 3mm diameter). They work well in both a digital (on/off) and analog (brightness, using PWM) context. Although there are slight differences in power requirements, using 100 Ohm resistors for all of them keeps things simple and works fine.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--right\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/72/Screen-Shot-2019-01-10-at-1.35.59-pm.png\" alt=\"RGB LED\" width=\"285\" height=\"300\">\n<figcaption >Source: Flickr - Original author <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/33504192@N00\">Oomlout</a> CC-BY-SA</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>On the fancier side of things are RGB LEDs, which can be set to any colour by mixing red, green and blue amounts.  This comes with some extra overhead in terms of pins (which could still be used either as analog or digital, although more usefully as analog to control the intensity of each colour channel). I generally find these a bit too fiddly and prefer to have pins free to use for other purposes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--right\" src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/72/digital-led-strip-lights-2103020_1280.jpg\" alt=\"RGB LED strip\" width=\"124\" height=\"300\">Where LEDs get a bit more interesting are the collections bound up with individually controllers, so that each LED in a strip (or panel) can be individually addressed. There are a couple of common controllers that seem to be equivalent (and from what I've read, sometimes when you order one you get the other): WS2812 and SK6812. These often come under Adafruit's branding of Neopixel, but this is what they are under the hood, and they work the same way.</p>\n<p>The beauty of these LED controllers is that you can chain them together and change their colour individually (as well as turning them on or off) with only one data pin and a power supply. The down side is that they are not rated for 3.3V and so you need to mix in an external power supply (I usually use 3xAA batteries for most of my projects that need more juice). You can buy these individually or in strips, but can always separate the strips in shorter ones and use them separately.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">I came across<a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2017/01/20/cheating-at-5v-ws2812-control-to-use-a-3-3v-data-line/\"> this hack</a> for running these lights off 3.3V and will have to try it out with the Micro:bit.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">When running a single LED for learning about the components, these LEDs run Just Fine from the standard 3.3V output of the Micro:bit. I have soldered a bunch of single LEDs to 3 pin female headers and use them when teaching about colour theory and letting students practice the basics of setting them up and controlling them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d0qkb1ui3\"><img class=\"post__image--right\" src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/72/servo.jpg\" alt=\"Servo motors\" width=\"162\" height=\"300\">Servos</h3>\n<p>I have a love/hate relationship with servos. On one hand, they fulfil a huge role in so many interesting hobbyist electronics projects, and on the other hand I have had so many finnicky problems with them in terms of reliability when not controlled by addons like the <a href=\"https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5623-servolite-board-for-move-mini.html\">Servo:Lite</a> board that presumably handle power regulation.</p>\n<p>Servos come in two varieties: continuous and standard. Continuous servos simply keep rotating in whatever direction and at whatever speed you tell them to (and thus are useful for [rather noisy] motors to drive wheels). Standard servos rotate to a specified angle and then stop, and are usually constrained to 180 degrees, although the cheaper varieties I use typically have a reliable range somewhere between 35 and 120 degrees.</p>\n<p>Both are very simple to program by sending an analog signal corresponding to the angle (or speed for continuous rotation) to move to. A value of 0 is typically off, but I believe this works slightly differently with MicroPython compared to MakeCode.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\"><a href=\"https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5612-kitronik-i2c-servo-driver-board-for-the-bbc-microbit.html\">Kitronik's 16 servo controller board</a> is a bit more complicated to program since it uses the I2C interface rather than a single pin per servo. There's a MicroPython library <a href=\"https://github.com/KitronikLtd/micropython-microbit-kitronik-16-servo-board\">available on Github</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">The <a href=\"https://www.dfrobot.com/\">DFRobot</a> <a href=\"https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1699.html\">Micro:mate addon board</a> is a much cheaper alternative for running higher power devices like servos off the Micro:bit.

They are very simple to wire up, with voltage and ground hooked up to either side, and the central pin connected to a data pin.</p>\n<p>Potentiometers are quite useful for a number of different applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Control the angle (or speed for continuous rotation) of a servo.</li>\n<li>Control the delay in between actions (e.g. blinking of an LED).</li>\n<li>Change frequency or tempo of music.</li>\n<li>Change red/green/blue component of LEDs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Be aware that there are different types of tapers for potentiometers: linear and logarithmic. Linear taper potentiometers change their resistance at a constant rate as they are turned, whilst logarithmic taper potentiometers do not. Linear taper potentiometers have a B before the resistance rating. e.g. B10K indicates a linear taper 10 kOhm potentiometer.<br><br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer#Resistance–position_relationship:_&quot;taper&quot;\">More info on Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d0qkcnbp5\"><img class=\"post__image--right\" src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/72/jack-861512_1280.jpg\" alt=\"3.5mm jack\" width=\"161\" height=\"300\">Speakers/Headphones</h3>\n<p>One of the things I found surprising was MicroPython's speech library and how terrible-yet-quite-usable the quality was, considering how constrained the Micro:bit is. The tone generation in the music library is also quite usable in a few different ways (note, register, duration or by frequency).</p>\n<p>Sound output on the other hand, is not very pleasant. You can hook up headphones and basic speakers very easily (data pin and ground), but volume control is not something you get as part of the package. Headphones tend to be uncomfortably loud, while speakers are prohibitably soft (for a class of 20 or so students). You can amplify using addons like Proto-Pic's amp:bit board, but that also hides the rest of the Micro:bit's pins from use.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">I have been experimenting with some cheap amplifying boards like the PAM8403 with some success. They require hooking up a 5V power supply to the amp however, so it's more wiring. Sound quality has varied with the samples I've used, but it has been reasonable for something that costs less than $1 and some come with a pre-soldered potentiometer for volume control.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d0ql0c0n9\"><img class=\"post__image--right\" src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/72/Screen-Shot-2019-01-10-at-4.10.42-pm.png\" alt=\"AM312 InfraRed Sensor\" width=\"108\" height=\"300\">Mini InfraRed Sensors (Mini PIR - AS312/AM312)</h3>\n<p>These PIR sensors are quite sensitive, in my testing triggering from about 3m away from the sensor for a human sized body. Unlike larger sensors there doesn't seem to be a way to change the amount of time the pin goes high for when it senses a heat source, with these triggering for about 2 seconds in my experience.</p>\n<p>These devices are used in a digital context, where 0 would indicate no motion sensed, and 1 that the sensor had been triggered. The 1 continues to be read for however long the triggered period is, so your code needs to cope with that (possibly waiting until the pin goes low to 0 again, depending on what else is happening in your execution loop).</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">Some IR sensors work with 3.3V logic while most are 5V. The larger units will have attached potentiometers for sensitivity and duration which they send a high voltage for. I haven't seen any of the 3.3V sensors which are customisable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d0rd8d51f\"><img class=\"post__image--right\" src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/72/Screen-Shot-2019-01-10-at-4.19.19-pm.png\" alt=\"IR Line Follower Module\" width=\"108\" height=\"300\">Line Follower IR Sensors (TCRT5000 based)</h3>\n<p>The line following sensor works in a similar way to the other IR sensor, but designed for reflected IR radiation at very short range. While it can be used for the intended purpose, I found this was also useful for detecting when items had been put into a container as well. One of my students created a donation box that thanked the donator when it detected something had passed the line sensor.</p>\n<p>I'm sure there are other unintended short range sensing uses for it as well (which is good because I accidentally ordered 20 of them instead of 2 because they were so cheap and I didn't read the item description carefully enough).</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d0ql73egb\">Temperature Sensors</h3>\n<p>Although the Micro:bit has a temperature sensor built in, it doesn't measure ambient temperature. Rather, it is the temperature of the device, and because it is integrated into the board, makes it less useful for measuring spot temperatures of any location that isn't at least the size of the Micro:bit itself.</p>\n<p>When I started looking at using Micro:bits, I already had some Arduino components sitting around, so I thought I'd have a go at getting them working. The DHT11 (temperature and humidity sensor) is pretty common and I had a couple of them, but apparently the Micro:bit can't drive it (and library which is present in the main MicroPython distribution isn't present in the Micro:bit flavour).</p>\n<p>I have had a play with 10kOhm thermistors, which are basically the same as an LDR but for temperature (and wired the same way). They're fine for measuring changes in temperature, but you would need to calibrate the analog readings against known temperatures to turn it into a traditional temperature measurement.</p>\n<p>I finally ordered some TMP36 sensors, which work off 3.3V and <strong>do</strong> give you an accurate temperature reading (after dividing by 10) without the need for your own calibration process. As a bonus, they're quite cheap (I paid around $3 for 5).</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d0ql7vcdc\">Custom Addons</h2>\n<p>As well as looking at individual components, I've used a few different custom expansion boards, as well as some basic breakout boards to access the rest of the Micro:bit pins.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Although these will generally improve the usability for the components which they are designed for (the servo boards in particular), they often tie up more pins on the board than they need to, restricting integration with other components.<br><br>Because of the very easy networking available with the Micro:bit, it is possible to work around these limitations by using multiple devices, but it adds to the complexity to program for syncing and message passing in addition to sensing and control.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5623-servolite-board-for-move-mini.html\">Kitronik Servo:Lite<br></a></p>\n<p>These boards have a strip of 5 NeoPixel LEDs, 2 sets of pins for servos, and a 3xAAA battery backpack. Apart from a slight design issue with clearance for the USB cable to the Micro:bit being very tight (it works with the cables that come with the Micro:bit but many other USB cables don't fit), they work brilliantly. The downside is the board screws onto all the terminals of the Micro:bit, so you can't attach any other devices.</p>\n<p>They have been very reliable for servo control, and the lights are a nice bonus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5612-kitronik-i2c-servo-driver-board-for-the-bbc-microbit.html\">Kitronik 16 Servo Controller</a></p>\n<p>If all you want to do is control servos, and lots of them, then this is for you. You can get a MicroPython moduly for controlling it from <a href=\"https://github.com/KitronikLtd/micropython-microbit-kitronik-16-servo-board\">this GitHub repo</a>. It uses I2C, so my understanding of how it works is nonexistant, but it works fine (I used it for the servo control of my haunted house project).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.proto-pic.co.uk/ampbit-class-d-amplifier-for-microbit-with-headphone-jack.html\">Proto-Pic Amp:Bit</a></p>\n<p>The Amp:bit is a nice way of hooking up speakers and headphones. It has contacts for soldering on pins or direct connections to a speaker, and as a 3.5mm jack for plugging in headphones, as well as a much needed volume control.</p>\n<p>Again, this board cuts you off from using the rest of the pins on the Micro:bit as it uses a slot-in system like most expansion boards, and provides no other contacts. A better solution seems to be the <a href=\"https://www.monkmakes.com/mb_speaker/\">Monk Makes Speaker</a>, which doesn't slot in the Micro:bit, allowing for more flexible projects.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5620-motor-driver-board-for-the-bbc-microbit-v2.html\">Kitronik Motor Driver Board</a></p>\n<p>I have a couple of these but just haven't really used them much. Without a gearbox the small motors you generally get just don't have the torque to drive much. I have however looked at some alternative uses for motors, like 3D printing water pump and air pump housings which look promising.</p>\n<p>Originally I thought these would only do full power to motors, but apparently they do support PWM for slowing the motors down, which would make them more useful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5625-zip-halo-for-the-bbc-microbit.html\">ZIP Halo</a> RGB LED ring</p>\n<p>These are basically a 24 LED WS2812 strip arranged in a ring around the Micro:bit. The board screws onto the terminals of the Micro:bit, but does break out a general purpose pin for other uses, as well as an extension pin for attaching more LEDs onto the 'end' of the 24 provided. One of my student projects was one of these rings with a ring of 60 extended on the outside, to make a clock.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1699.html\">DFRobot Micro:mate</a></p>\n<p>These addon boards screw onto the Micro:bit's 0 and GND terminals, and use spring-loaded feet to break out 6 pins (0, 1, 2 and 8, 12 and 16). They have an additional MicroUSB port which can be used for 5V power delivery to pins 8, 12 and 6 (which can be switched between 3.3V and 5V) and also feeds power back to the Micro:bit (although it can't be used for programming, which leads to lots of \"why isn't my Micro:bit being deteced - oh I have it plugged into the wrong port\").</p>\n<p>They are quite cheap (around $10AUD) and I have found them to be quite reliable for hooking up servos, LED strips, and other higher power uses. Unlike the Servo:lite board, having 6 pins broken out means there is a lot of flexibility available.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d0qkdm3c8\">Issues</h2>\n<p>A lot of electronics kit, particularly designed for Arduino, runs off 5V, rather than 3.3V. Whilst you can externally power some of these, it's a bit less straightforward for others. Also, often the power requirements aren't always obvious, for example some common ultrasonic range finders come in 5V and 3.3V varieties (HC-SR04 vs HC-SR04P).</p>\n<p>One of my early problems working with Micro:bits and breakout boards is figuring out which pins are capable of what. For example, unless the display has been disabled, some pins are dedicated to driving that (and you'll get an error about pins being in Display Mode, without much direction in what to do next - display.off() solves that problem). Some pins don't do analog operations, two pins are reserved to trigger button A and B events, etc. A diagram and a decent explanation that outlines some of this is on<a href=\"https://microbit.org/guide/hardware/pins/\"> the pins page of the Micro:bit site</a>.</p>\n<p>The biggest issue, which is not unique to the Micro:bit is the usual problem of figuring out whether something not working is the fault of bad code, faulty wiring, or faulty understanding of how the circuit is supposed to work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d0ql64jba\">Yet to dig into</h2>\n<p>I still have only a really hazy understanding of I2C and SPI. I know what they do, but the <strong>how</strong> is pretty vague. I still need to get my head around this.</p>\n<p>The Micro:bits are great to work with in the classroom, but you pretty quickly hit a ceiling of what they can do with complex systems since there is only so much memory to go around. For example my Haunted House project's servo code ran into the wall on numerous occasions when I was developing it (and the error messages you get for that are <strong>not</strong> helpful).</p>\n<p>I've bought myself a couple of ESP32 boards to look at how practical they are to use (much cheaper than the Micro:bits, more resources, but not as much built in). The MicroPython environment is quite similar, you can get 802.11 and Bluetooth built in, threading and more. The downside is they don't act as a USB storage device like the Micro:bit does, so flashing programs and firmware involves fiddling with COM ports, potentially install drivers, etc. There is an IDE which helps with this from DFRobot (<a href=\"https://github.com/DFRobot/uPyCraft\">https://github.com/DFRobot/uPyCraft</a>) but I haven't used it much yet.</p>",

I've mainly been using BBC Micro:bits, since they are quite affordable, robust, are easy to hook up to a range of widely available components, and are easy to program in a few different environments (MicroPython being my weapon of choice).</p>\n<p>To keep myself entertained, and to provide my students with a sample project (although more complex code-wise than they're likely to accomplish) I decided to make something myself this term while my class worked on their own group projects (theirs are themed after the UN Global Goals). I had ideas for either building a carousel or a light gun game, and settled on the latter so I didn't have to <em>also</em> tackle 3D printing out cams and gears and the like.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/298976485\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/298976806\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>I have designs and code in a <a href=\"https://github.com/zarify/microbit/tree/master/Haunted%20House\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repo</a> if anyone wants to have a look or use any of my ideas - there is also a list of components I used.

Since the LEDs drew more power than was available from the Micro:bit itself (particularly since it also had to supply power to the LDRs) I decided to use transistors to switch power from an external battery pack to the LEDs. Since the servos were plugged into a dedicated servo controller board, they too were very straightforward.</p>\n<p>I've been getting more interested in laser cutting recently, and so the physical design was really enjoyable. I mocked up my designs by hand before drawing the pieces up in Affinity Designer (not really the right tool for the job, but it works). I had used <a href=\"http://www.makercase.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MakerCase </a>with my students before to design simple boxes with cutouts, so I had some idea of how to design finger joints for some structure, and the main challenge was making the design big enough to house the components and allow a decent level of detail in the extras like the dead tree and the spooks inside. Apart from a couple of stuff-ups where my mental model didn't translate to the real world that well resulting in re-cuts, this went pretty smoothly, although it took about a week, mostly due to only being able to cut at work (and when I wasn't teaching 😅).</p>\n<p>I was expecting the code to be the easiest part of the whole exercise, since that is what I'm most familiar with. The basic idea for the two Micro:bits took a couple of hours to hash out in my head and roughly debug without having access to the boards. The wrinkle came when I actually loaded the code - or rather when I tried to.</p>\n<p>Initially, my relatively simple model of a two-class program with a basic event loop was rejected as being too big to parse! I trimmed it down a bit (goodbye docstrings!) and tried again, only to encounter a memory error. Occasionally, the Micro:bit was even nice enough to tell me a number after the memory error, which I ended up guessing referred to how much of my code it failed to load, since it went down as I trimmed out functions, shortened strings, shifted dictionaries to lists, collapsed multiple objects to a singleton, and so on. The joys of programming on microcontrollers in interpreted languages!</p>\n<p>Eventually I ended up with some plain old runtime errors, and I don't think I've ever been so happy to see one, since it meant at least my code was running on the board. Coding was still the least time-consuming part of the process, but ended up being a surprisingly challenging exercise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d0rduh351\">Reflection</h2>\n<p>The whole process was really enjoyable - it ended up looking great, and works just as I envisioned it (although I didn't imagine the noisy servos in my head 😐). I haven't gotten around to building the light gun yet, since I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how to get a nice tight beam from an LED without expensive optics or shifting to a laser, but for now a torch is sufficient.</p>\n<p>I'm planning on adding a score board using a third Micro:bit sitting on the top of the structure (maybe when I design and cut out a tiled roof), and since I already have all the radio messages from the other two boards, I shouldn't need to add very much code to the others. This is a good thing, since I was getting to the point where adding in debugging messages to the servo board was pushing me over the memory limit!</p>\n<p>I learned a fair bit about mixing different power levels in circuits along the way which I'll be able to use in my teaching, and I'll certainly have a few gotchas to look out for if any of my students start putting together complex programs.</p>",

            "summary": "This is the first year that Digital Technologies has been a mandatory&hellip;",
            "content_html": "<p>This is the first year that Digital Technologies has been a mandatory part of the Australian curriculum through to Year 8. Whilst the subject area contains a <a href=\"https://k10outline.scsa.wa.edu.au/home/teaching/curriculum-browser/technologies/digital-technologies2#year-7-syllabus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">number of different topics</a>, the one that generally comes to mind (helped in no small part by our politicians and media 🙄 banging on about 'coding' this, and 'coding' that) is programming and algorithmic thinking.</p>\n<p>Since our education sector has a fairly comprehensive set of licenses to all things Microsoft, we have Minecraft: Education Edition licenses for all of our students and staff. While I am not that big of a fan of Minecraft's system of switches and redstone wiring (I prefer my programming higher level and less clunky), I do quite like plugging in external programming through Code Connection, as I've written about before in toying with <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/70\" title=\"Minecraft Edu Edition: Geological Surveys\">core sampling</a>.</p>\n<p>With my Year 7s I thought I'd try out covering the programming component with <a href=\"https://education.minecraft.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Minecraft: EE</a> and <a href=\"https://education.minecraft.net/trainings/code-builder-for-minecraft-education-edition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Code Connection</a>. It gives students some nice ways to visualise problems they need to solve, as they can build/prototype a solution and then design a program which creates that solution for them.</p>\n<h2>Aim</h2>\n<p>I've been kicking around this idea since attending a workshop on Minecraft: EE with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kieranbailey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kieran Bailey</a> at the <a href=\"https://ecawa.wa.edu.au/conferences/2018-state-conference/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ECAWA State Conference</a> earlier this year. Initially I was thinking about pursuing a series of lessons looking at automated agriculture (and probably will revisit that later on), but ended up with some more disjointed ideas building off Code Connection tutorials (so that students had somewhere to start in a self-paced fashion, and more importantly someone else had written the material!) and examining programming fundamentals like looping, conditionals, and variables.</p>\n<p>At the end of the series of lessons, I got students to build a few programs for me. There was some mixed success, and I'll discuss the successes and failures a bit further down.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--right\" src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/71/my_head_final.PNG\" alt=\"Heads\" width=\"880\" height=\"621\">When designing the tasks, I had a few aims in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get students to create something engaging where they wanted to solve the problem for themselves, not because it was an assessment.</li>\n<li>Have a range of different ways of solving the problems.</li>\n<li>Involve physical prototypes so that students could build the solution themselves to help them visualise the outcome and assist with programming in 3D space.</li>\n<li>Make it difficult or impossible to share answers, whilst still allowing students to learn techniques off each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--right\" src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/71/signatures.png\" alt=\"Lava Signatures\" width=\"964\" height=\"303\">My tasks were to create programs that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a blocky version of the student's own head.</li>\n<li>Sign their initials in lava in a trench in the ground.</li>\n<li>Build chess boards of a specified size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first two tasks I'm fairly happy with, but the last one, although I like the problem in itself as there are multiple ways to solve it, obviously doesn't satisfy my last aim.</p>\n<h2>Failures</h2>\n<p>The first group through a new course is always the hardest, as it's difficult to pitch assessments at the right level to challenge but still include all students. My expectations were definitely too high with this set of tasks, and will need adjustments to both how I teach the content and in the difficulty of the assessment next year.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--right\" src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/71/tutorial_snipped.PNG\" alt=\"OneNote tutorial snippet\" width=\"573\" height=\"433\">One of the failures of Minecraft: EE is that since everything is kept in local storage for each student, and the process of switching programs is quite cumbersome (involving a lot of external resource loading, despite programs and Minecraft server being on the local machine), it can be quite tough to ensure students are on track rather than merrily running about doing their own thing. My lesson format for this topic is typically a step by step tutorial (with explanations and screenshots) in OneNote for students to follow, along with 2-3 extension activities at the end which use the concept in a different setting. In future I'll get students to add their own screenshots to a table at the end showing their code and results from the extension activities in order to keep them a bit more accountable.</p>\n<p>As the subject is mandatory now rather than an elective, there are many different literacy (and numeracy - particularly involving 3D space) levels who need to be catered for. Although I try to differentiate instruction in a number of ways (demo and explain verbally, self-paced written and graphical tutorials, teach by the side), it is always surprising who struggles with some concepts or learning methods. Whilst it is incredibly time consuming, next time around I'll add some video tutorials to the mix as well as some smaller explainers and demos to cover some more bases.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Successes</h2>\n<p>In 2018, Minecraft is an ancient beast, but I've been impressed at the coverage of students who, whilst initially complaining about it, have gotten right into the platform and a lot of the coding problems. Minecraft: EE has been a win on the engagement front.</p>\n<p>Although it's by far the hardest of the three problems I gave students (and stupidly, I put it first in the task list) the \"build your own head\" problem has proven to be a win for getting students to really think about the task in a number of different ways. With some tweaking and more targeted introductory lessons, I think this has a lot of potential for future assessment.</p>\n<p>Minecraft: EE and Code Connection has a range of really nice tutorials to build from, which provides a nice gentle introduction for both students and teachers, and they are general enough that I have been able to introduce several different concepts using them as a base.</p>\n<p>Using a Minecraft world as a prototyping playground is often hilarious. There have been a number of nightmare hellscapes of half-formed heads that my students have created while debugging their programs.</p>",

The Agent is a code-controlled character that can build from its inventory, attack and destroy surrounding blocks, and do basic sensing of its environment. The builder is an invisible constructor which is used for raising structures fairly quickly; it doesn't have an inventory and can't interact with its environment beyond placing blocks.</p>\n<p>An example of the two interacting could be using the Builder to construct a house shape (e.g. walls and ceiling) and then using the Agent to dig out and place doors and windows.</p>\n<h2>Geology</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/286263292\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" ></iframe></p>\n<p>I wanted to try out something a bit different, and so I got to thinking about core samples. The Agent can dig, so why not use that ability for something interesting like looking at what it digs through (one of my lessons with my students was using <strong>if</strong> statements to dig out diamonds from rock).</p>\n<p>The Agent can pick up the blocks it digs through, so I decided to build a core sampler. It would dig down until it hit bedrock (the indestructable blocks at the bottom of the Minecraft world), and then I could use those blocks to analyse the composition of the earth it dug through.</p>\n<p>One of the issues I ran into straight away is that the Agent and the Builder both have a maximum operating range away from the player, and so I often had to teleport the player to them in order to continue processing.</p>\n<p>Otherwise this worked pretty well. Here are the commands I used for the program.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/70/gallery/tp_snap.PNG\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/70/gallery/tp_snap-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"Teleport Initialisation\" width=\"413\" height=\"236\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Grabbing agent and storing coordinates.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/70/gallery/core_snap.PNG\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/70/gallery/core_snap-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"Digging the core sample\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Digs until it hits bedrock, collecting blocks and recording IDs.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/70/gallery/buildcore_snap.PNG\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/70/gallery/buildcore_snap-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"Building the core sample\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">The core sample just recreates an array of block IDs.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/70/gallery/graph_1_snap.PNG\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/70/gallery/graph_1_snap-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"Building the graph\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Use the Agent inventory to build the graph.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/70/gallery/graph_2_snap.PNG\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/70/gallery/graph_2_snap-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"Last bit of building the graph\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Lots of special cases for blocks which don't drop themselves.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>I thought about using the <strong>lastBlock</strong> array of the blocks that had been encountered for building the frequency graph, but didn't really like the idea of implementing a sorting algorithm in MakeCode and in the end figured that since the Agent collects the same block together in its inventory anyway, that would make a nice shortcut.</p>\n<p>The main issue with using the Agent inventory is many blocks do not drop themselves when broken and picked up. For example each of the ore types (coal, iron, gold, diamond, lapis lazuli, redstone, and emerald) drop non-buildable blocks, resulting in a long and rather ugly selection sequence translating the dropped material into the original block (and conveniently ignoring what happens if a single block drops more than one item!).</p>\n<p>If you would like to try this out and don't want to spend forever dragging blocks around yourself, feel free to <a href=\"../../../../../media/files/minecraft-Geological Survey.mkcd\">download my MakeCode file here</a> and load it into Code Connection yourself.</p>",

It generates static pages, but has a nice CMS style GUI editor that you can create posts in and manage the site before pushing it out to a hosting platform (in this instance Github Pages).</p>\n<p>The downside is of course, migrating content out of Squarespace. Although they offer exporting to WordPress style XML, actually importing that content anywhere has been a less than ideal experience. Publii includes a tool to do this automatically, but nicely sorting those imported posts into tag categories is less fun, since you have to manually edit each post (lucky I'm a lazy writer!) and add relevant tags, and the automatic image downloading failed due some screwy file naming in the Squarespace export. This would be ok if images were stored in a central repository, but unfortunately, Publii stores posts in individual folders in the root directory, with images stored within those folders, meaning lots of manual fiddling with file locations, editing HTML in individual posts, etc.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1d0rdvsr00\">Security of Wireless Networks</h1>\n<p>My <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/67\">previous lesson</a> looking at wireless networks used Microbits and their Bluetooth networking to illustrate some of the problems with local wireless networks (as opposed to general internet connectivity, which we mostly did by doing speed tests and complaining about the school's net connection :).</p>\n<p>At the end I wrote a bit about what I wanted to do with the next lesson, which was look at some basic crypto to handle the eavesdropping problem we had when someone else listened to the same channel we were communicating on.</p>\n<p>(<strong>Note for anyone who wants to yell at me through the internet:</strong> I'm well aware that this is not anything approaching real crypto, and I'll be the first to tell my kids that if they want to know more about how modern crypto really works, the first thing they need to do is go and find someone who really understands it - this is about what it does, not how it works.)</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--right\" ><img src=\"https://headtilt.me/media/posts/68/Almighty+XOR.png\" alt=\" The Almighty XOR \">\n<figcaption >The Almighty XOR and his hammer MjollNOR</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>After running into a bit of a wall trying to get a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">XOR cipher</a> working in the block coding interface, I started to dig into the MicroPython interface instead. Along the way I discovered that there was a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://codewith.mu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rather nice basic IDE called Mu</a>, which lets you flash your code straight to the device, as well as running a REPL (Run-Evaluate-Print-Loop) to do easy code testing (which also works breaking into running code, so you can load functions onto the Microbit, then run and test them in the REPL interface).</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1d0rdvsr01\">The Results</h1>\n<p>I haven't used this with my classes yet, but I'll edit this post at the end of the week and add in how things went.</p>\n<p>This version uses a shake of the Microbit to choose a random image, mostly because getting A+B button presses working was annoying - see the Issues section later on, but also because I wanted to play with accelerometer gestures in Python. The A button transmits the image over whatever channel the device is listening to.</p>\n<p>The B button switches channels, but I also made it switch between clear text and cipher text modes. You will see in the video when I press the B button for a second time on a channel the top-right LED lights up and the channel number stays the same. This indicates cipher text mode. It still listens on the same channel, but uses its cipher bitstring to decode any communication it receives (whether or not it's actually encrypted :).</p>\n<p>Below is a short video showing how this version of the program works.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/217366606?wmode=opaque&amp;api=1\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Dodgy Crypto with Networked Microbits\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Again, if you want to look at the Python code, or download the .hex file to load onto a Microbit via copying, you can grab them from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/zarify/microbit/tree/master/bad_crypto\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the github repo</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1d0rdvsr02\">Issues</h1>\n<p>As usual, there were some issues I ran into along the way.</p>\n<p>Event-driven programming in MicroPython just isn't there. With the block interface it <em>seems</em> that event listeners get their own processes, so you can break into say a radio's receive section using a button's code. With Python the lack of event listeners is slightly mitigated with things like buttons keeping track of whether they have been pressed since you last examined them (<strong>button_a.is_pressed()</strong> vs <strong>button_a.was_pressed()</strong> for example). This is fine for a simple main loop, but you still need to be careful not to lock yourself out with delays, particularly since I found a few situations where I had to build in delays just to cope with the length of time it takes to un-depress a button.</p>\n<p>Debugging is still annoying. Let's say there's a syntax error in your code, because you're just not paying attention. The Microbit will try and be helpful and, when it flashes and restarts, will tell you about any errors using the LED array. However, trying to read an error message scrolling across the LED array is just plain painful, since it is quite bright, and also only shows you about a character and a half at a time. If you're lucky, opening a REPL will also give you the error message in a way that preserves your eyes and your sanity, but I didn't have this work all the time. I just tried to ignore the bright lights, and focus on the bit where it told you the line number of the error.</p>\n<p>I quite like Mu. It's clean, simple, has (slightly overzealous) code completion, and it's nice getting to the REPL and being able to do code introspection. BUT Mu's 'check syntax' function checks syntax, but also highlights lines that don't obey its style guidelines. So this means if you're somewhat lazy about putting spaces after commas in argument lists or list definitions, you'll get exactly the same red indicator at the start of the line as a genuine syntax error (and it is <strong>very</strong> opinionated about coding style, oh, and not being able to find an EOF at the end of the file).</p>\n<p>Lastly, writing code which you can only interface with using two buttons and some basic gestures is hard. Talk about minimalism in UI design.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1d0re0qbd0\">Overview</h1>\n<p>Part of the new Digital Technologies curriculum for year 7 and 8 involves students learning about wired and wireless networks, and methods of data transmission and security. There are activities from the Digital Technologies Learning Hub that deal with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/teachers/lesson-ideas/computer-chatter-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">routing</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/teachers/lesson-ideas/computer-chatter-2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issues with performance</a> (that are pretty good unplugged activities). I use these or variations on these when I teach those concepts, but I wanted to put together something that actually involved technology in the classroom, and dealt with ideas a bit lower down the network stack.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1d0re0qbd1\">Playing with Microbits</h1>\n<p>This year we got some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://microbit.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BBC Microbits</a>, and I've been looking at how to use them with my classes in an effective (and manageable) way. After playing around with some basic communication via Bluetooth with the Microbits, I thought I'd have a crack at writing some simple programs for students to use to encounter some of the problems with wireless networking, and use it as a hook for looking at ways that we've fixed those problems.</p>\n<p>Microbits can broadcast messages via Bluetooth Low Energy, and allow you to choose the channel that they transmit/listen on per device. I wrote a (slightly tedious) program in the blocks interface (link here: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pxt.microbit.org/06484-09741-52714-91595\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feel free to use/abuse it</a>) that did the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A button: choose a random picture to display on the screen</li>\n<li>B button: broadcast the picture, pixel by pixel, to any listening Microbits</li>\n<li>A+B buttons: switch to the next channel (cycle through 7 channels)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The video below shows two of them in action.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/217261990?wmode=opaque&amp;api=1\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Wireless Picture Transmission with Microbits\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1d0re0qbd2\">Lesson ideas</h1>\n<p>If you dig through the code for the program, you'll see there are artificial pauses between the transmission of each 'pixel'/LED state. I ran into speed issues when transmitting them as fast as I could, where a number of pixels would not light up. This sort of worked out for the best, since it gave me an artificial latency figure I could manipulate, as well as giving students the idea that not just the lit up LED states were being transmitted, but also the state of the unlit ones.</p>\n<p>I didn't want to send the state of the entire board at once, since two of the concepts I wanted students to discover were those of attenuation and interference from signal-absorbing materials (mostly from, in my words: \"giant sacks of water\", i.e. lots of students standing in between the transmitter and receiver). Since pixels were being transmitted one at a time, there was plenty of opportunity for images to be corrupted in transmission. I had kids hiding behind metal doors of cabinets, calling to each other across the courtyard asking what picture popped up on the receiver, and basically seeing what broke when. It was chaotic but pretty neat.</p>\n<p>I have two other teachers who deliver at the same time as me, and I had prepped them with their own Microbits for that lesson. I didn't realise that one of them was in the next room however, which made the fact that all devices started transmitting on Channel 1 entertaining at the start of the lesson, but also a good jumping off point for why we need different channels, and rules for effective transmission in crowded networks.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1d0re0qbd3\">Where to next</h1>\n<p>The block code is really quite limiting for this sort of program. It involved all sorts of horrible attempts at type casting, and was both fun to write (in the end!) and quite frustrating. At the same time it was good to see how complex a solution to my problem I could get without having to switch to Python.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d0re0qbd4\">Some take-aways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm not sure if it's an feature of the block code or not, but you can't set the radios up to listen for different types of messages. For example you can't have integers, strings, and key/value pairs being broadcast and figure out what to do with them based on the type of message. This is why I ended up having the horrible reset method in there which checked the length of the value in the key/value pair.</li>\n<li>The block code has a method for changing strings to integers, but doesn't seem to have a way to change integers to strings. This is relevant because I had a go at transmitting the entire state of the LED array as a bit string (see the bit at the end on next lesson) to avoid having to process each LED individually (which worked well for this lesson anyway, but isn't ideal).</li>\n<li>The block interface handles if-else if-else if-...etc really nicely. Hit the config button in an if block, and then drag in as many else-if blocks as you need. Huge improvement on the way something like Scratch works.</li>\n<li>The simulator is just rubbish for any moderately complicated radio transmission. I got an incredibly basic program to work in the simulator and was briefly impressed, but this one just refused to work at all, despite working fine on the real hardware.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d0re0qbd5\">Encryption</h2>\n<p>We ended the lesson with the problems of clear text communication, with lots of students suggesting that we need a \"different language\" so that eavesdroppers don't know what we're saying to each other. I've had mixed success looking at encryption with this level of students before, so want to try something different this time around.</p>\n<p>Usually there's lots of historical navel gazing at Caesar Ciphers, moving onto columnar ciphers and the like, and then we run out of time and move on. This time I want to look at one time pads (well, actually multi time pads, but I don't want to have to figure out how to transcribe a one time pad into each Microbit using two physical buttons each time - <em>sorry serious security people!</em>) using XOR, and then try and find a good way of ending up at the idea of public/private keys, if not an actual implementation.</p>\n<p>My plan is to implement the program I used for this class in Python, and then, with better control over the actual data, set up the devices with their own pads in pairs to use, so we can see how this affects others ability to eavesdrop on the transmitted pictures, despite still using the same channel.</p>",
