<meta name="description" content="I remember someone else talking up Slack&rsquo;s release notes before, but looking at them side by side with Box&rsquo;s lately&hellip;
I honestly don&rsquo;t know why Box bothered with more than the first line since the other three dot points mean exactly the same as the single first dot point, providing no additional information at all.
Slack does a great job of what is arguably the job of release notes: information about features, and which bugs have been fixed. More importantly, they do it in such a way that you might actually read the release notes because they are entertaining, not just because you might be frustrated with a problem in an earlier version and you want to know if it&rsquo;s fixed yet.">
